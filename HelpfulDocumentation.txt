"The underlying architecture in BCM2836 is identical to BCM2835. The only significant difference is the removal of the ARM1176JZF-S processor and replacement with a quad-core Cortex-A7 cluster."

Board crystal timer (local timer) frequency is 19.2 MHz, but it defaults to 1 MHz due to the timer divisor.
It also ticks on each clock edge so it's effectively 2 MHz by default.

Registers:
r0-r12: general purpose
r13: stack register  sp
r14: link register   lr
r15: program counter pc
APSR: Current ALU flags (don't use this, use CPSR)
CPSR: https://www.heyrick.co.uk/armwiki/The_Status_register
SPSR: Saved CPSR

Multi-register load/store:
	LDMFD: ! means writeback, don't use wtih ^ suffix
	STMFD: Same.
