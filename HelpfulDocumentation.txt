"The underlying architecture in BCM2836 is identical to BCM2835. The only significant difference is the removal of the ARM1176JZF-S processor and replacement with a quad-core Cortex-A7 cluster."

Board crystal timer (local timer) frequency is 19.2 MHz, but it defaults to 1 MHz due to the timer divisor.
It also ticks on each clock edge so it's effectively 2 MHz by default.

Registers:
r0-r12: general purpose
r13: stack register  sp
r14: link register   lr
r15: program counter pc
APSR: Current ALU flags (don't use this, use CPSR)
CPSR: https://www.heyrick.co.uk/armwiki/The_Status_register
SPSR: Saved CPSR

Multi-register load/store:
LDMFD/STMFD: push/pop multiple registers from a Full (sp points to last occupied spot) Descending stack.
! prefix means writeback as in increment/decrement the stack pointer as necessary.
^ suffix on LDMFD means load the banked registers from user programs instead of whatever operating mode currently in.
^ suffix on STMFD means that we should restore the CPSR to the SPSR for user mode, use this as a return from trap instruction, ensuring that one of the registers you restore (the return address) goes into PC.
