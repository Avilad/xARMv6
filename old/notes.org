* boot process
1. GPU starts executing the first stage bootloader, which is built into the RP's
   ROM. All it does is read the SD card for a file called *bootcode.bin*, sticks
   it in the L2 cache, and starts running it
2. bootcode.bin enables SDRAM
3. bootcode.bin reads the GPU firmware start.elf
4. start.elf reads config.txt, cmdline.txt and kernel.img
