* Installation
** QEMU
The standard QEMU you get with the package manager won't work for this -- it's
2.5, but we need 2.6+, since it has native RPI support. Download the latest
stable release, 2.11, from https://download.qemu.org/

Open the README and follow the instructions to build it from source. You might
need to install a few packages to do so but it will tell you what you're
missing. 

Add the top level qemu-2.11.0 directory to your path. Go to build/arm-softmmu
and rename the executable qemu-system-arm to qemu-system-arm-2.11.0
** arm-none-eabi-gcc
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
#+END_SRC
You should also be able to get the binaries from here, if necessary
